# Refactor-Challenge


## Description


I am practicing refactoring code to make it more readable and accessible for others esepcailly regarding ADA compliance. I built this with starter code and just refactor it to gain better skills of ensuring code is easy to read.This solves the fact that if someone had gone into these files before rthey would have had trouble reading them and understanding what was being styled and made. I learned to work more with git, creating/deploying repositories and refactoring code. See preview picture below.
